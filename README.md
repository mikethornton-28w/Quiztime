1. Purpose of the Quiz app

This mobile app is a flashcard-style quiz application built for Android using Kotlin. Its primary goal is to help users test their general knowledge in a fun and interactive way. The quiz includes a series of true/false questions and displays feedbacks.

2.  Design Considerations

2.1 User-Friendly Interface:

The user interface (UI) was vital for the use of Kotlin programming language which is exceptionally compatible with Android system development. It provided simple navigation flow that was needed to operate Welcome, Quiz and Review screens.

 2.2 Layout and User Experience

To amplify user functionality an XML Layout was employed for the appâ€™s visual design. Various UI elements were systematically implemented:

Button: This multifunctional element was used to develop the True and false buttons for the questions and the start button was needed for starting the quiz.

TextView: This component efficiently conveys the feedback to users to see the results based on how they performed.

EditText: That component was used to display the title of the quiz app

Questions and user responses are passed between activities using Intents and ArrayLists.

3.1 GitHub Utilization

The project is fully managed on GitHub, allowing version control, issue tracking, and collaboration. Each commit reflects changes made to the project during development, providing a history of progress and bug fixes.

3.2 GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions was used to automate workflows such as:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically build and check the project for errors after each push.
- **Code Quality**: Ensure consistent standards and prevent regression by running checks on each pull request.


##  Conclusion

The Quiz Flashcard App demonstrates the fundamentals of mobile development using Kotlin and Android Studio, with an emphasis on clean design, interactive learning, and modular architecture. Through the use of activities, intent-based navigation, and simple data structures, it provides an engaging user experience while remaining easy to extend and maintain.

This project also integrates GitHub best practices and automation via GitHub Actions, making it a great foundation for learners or developers looking to build more advanced mobile apps. Whether used as a learning tool or a portfolio piece, it reflects good design principles and effective use of development workflows.
